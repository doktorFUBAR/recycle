# Recycle - eco-friendly bike tours :bike:

## Project brief
This was an early project I did in school, focused on HTML/CSS.
I was tasked with making a website for a fictional company called Recycle,
which does guided bicycle tours with a focus on being eco-friendly.

## End resut
The page is pretty simple. It's responsive and clear. Personally I would do some changes to its design today,
and maybe convert the CSS to SCSS. I've later updated it and added some minimal JavaScript functionality.
This project was included in my year 1 portfolio in school.
